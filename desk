chapter 26 Running a Datacenter 459
A herd of cattle is a group of many similar animals. If you have a herd of cows
each one is treated the same. This permits us the benefits of mass-production. All
cattle receive the same living conditions, the same food, the same medical treatment,
the same everything. They all have the same personality, or at least are
treated as if they do. There are no cute outfits. The use of mass-production techniques
keeps maintenance costs low and improves profits at scale: Saving a dollar
per cow can multiply to hundreds of thousands in total savings.
Likewise, machines can be considered cattle when they are similar enough
that they can all be managed the same way. This can be done at different levels
of abstraction. For example, perhaps the OS is treated generically even though the
hardware may comprise any number of virtual or physical machine configurations.
Or perhaps the machine hardware, OS, and applications are all the same, but the
data they access is different. This is typical in a large web hosting farm, where
the only difference is which specific web site is being served by each machine.
Preferably the systems we deal with are fungible resources: Any one unit can
substitute for any other.
A related metaphor is the snowflake. A snowflake is even more unique than a
pet. It is one of a kind. A system may have started out similar to others, but it was
customized, modified, and eventually becomes unlike any other system.
